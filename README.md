# Statebus Rails
Bringing the magical world of [Statebus](https://stateb.us) to [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

### Installation
Add to your gemfile the standard way:
```ruby
gem 'statebus-rails'
```

Inside of your `application.js` file add the line:
```javascript
//= include statebus-rails
```

You're ready to start building with Statebus!

### Why use Statebus?
[Statebus](https://stateb.us) is a new JavaScript framework that provides reactivity and synchronicity out of the box. Building real-time, collaborative applications is usually a big ol' pain in the butt. Statebus makes it easy to do things that have historically been time consuming and challenging. Why expend brain power on the boring, tedious stuff, when Statebus can do it for you? Your brain will thank you.

[Statebus](https://stateb.us) improves HTTP and cleans up the entire programming stack, eliminating the need for complex web frameworks. These frameworks have formed a patchwork of layers and hacks all built on top of HTTP to emulate real-time app synchronization. Without them you'll write way less code. And programming will becomes way more fun. Guarunteed Â©

### What is Statebus?
1. A new version of HTTP that adds synchronization.  
Makes dynamic sites update automatically.

2. A new synchronous programming architecture.  
Like React, but across the whole stack. No more callbacks. Separates code from state.

3. A backwards-compatible library you can include in your existing website.  
Include in nodejs or client side to get Statebus features in any web app.

4. A cutting-edge synchronization algorithm.

### Statebus + Rails = Your new favorite stack
Like Rails, Statebus was designed to take all of the pain out of building modern, dynamic, JavaScript based web apps. Statebus uses CoffeeScript templating, meaning it feels a lot like building an app with Ruby. I built this gem to help promote [Statebus](https://stateb.us) and get it in the hands of more Ruby/Rails developers.


### More coming soon!
Both [Statebus](https://stateb.us) and this gem are a work in progress. The next version of Statebus - version 7 - will be rebranded as [Braid](https://braid.news). This gem will be renamed once that happens, so keep an eye out! 

Join the [Statebus / Braid Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/braid-http) to follow along with development.
