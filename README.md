# Statebus Rails
Bringing the magical world of [Statebus](https://stateb.us) to [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

### Why use Statebus?
[Statebus](https://stateb.us) is a reactive, synchronous JavaScript framework. Building a real-time collaborative application is usually a big ol' pain in the butt. Statebus makes it really easy to do things that have historically been time consuming and challenging to build. Why expend brain power on the boring, tedious stuff, when Statebus can do it for you? Your brain will thank you.

[Statebus](https://stateb.us) improves HTTP and cleans up the entire programming stack, eliminating the need for complex web frameworks. These frameworks form a patchwork of layers and hacks that have been built on top of HTTP to emulate synchronization. Without them you'll use way less code. And programming will become way more fun.

### What is Statebus?
1. A new version of HTTP that adds synchronization.
Makes dynamic sites update automatically.

2. A new synchronous programming architecture.
Like React, but across the whole stack. No more callbacks. Separates code from state.

3. A backwards-compatible library you can include in your existing website.
Include in nodejs or client side to get Statebus features in any web app.

4. A cutting-edge synchronization algorithm.

### Statebus + Rails = Your new favorite stack
Like Rails, Statebus was designed to take all of the pain out of building modern, dynamic, JavaScript based web apps. Statebus uses CoffeeScript templating, meaning it feels a lot like building an app with Ruby. I built this gem to help promote [Statebus](https://stateb.us) and get it in the hands of more Ruby/Rails developers.

Both [Statebus](https://stateb.us) and this gem are a work in progress. Please visit the [Statebus Github Repo](https://github.com/invisible-college/statebus) to learn more, and check out the [Statebus Tutorial](https://stateb.us/tutorial) to get started building apps using this amazing framework.
